# Project Description

Chess. 

### Goal of the Game : checkmate your opponent (leave the king with no possible moves)

### Pieces: 

Pawn : moves up two or one. Takes diagonally. 

Rook : Moves horizontally and vertically. 

Bishop : Moves diagonally. 

Knight : Moves two in any direction, then one left/right of the direction it went in.

Queen : Can go in any straight line

King : Moves one in any direction

### Mechanics: 

Check : When a piece can "take" the king (taking the king is illegal though don't do that, of course the code prevents you from doing so but yeah don't do that), you have to move the king or move another piece to block.  

Checkmate : King has no places to move and you lose

Promotion : When a pawn reaches the other end of the board, it promotes into a Queen/Rook/Bishop/Knight

Castling : Moves king two spaces and puts rook in the space it went in front of
